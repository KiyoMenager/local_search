defmodule Permutation do
  @moduledoc """
  Functions that work on circular permutation.

  In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of arranging all
  the members of a set into some sequence or order, or if the set is already
  ordered, rearranging (reordering) its elements, a process called permuting.

  A circular permutation means the last element has for successor the first.

  Returns a list where each item is the result of invoking fun on each
  corresponding edge of permutation.

  Note that since the successeur of the last element in the permutation is the
  first element, the last considered edge is {last, first}

      iex> Permutation.edge_map([1, 2, 3], &(&1 + &2))
      [3, 5, 4]
